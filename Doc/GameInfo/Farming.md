Milk Melon

4 stages
2 harvests

1 milkmelon is 5 organic

1 milkmelon + 1 salt + 1 water is 3 milk, or 15 organic

To get TWO TWO TWO seeds:

* 1 milkmelon
* 5 sand
* 2 mulch

1 seed = 4 seeds

Plant 96 milkmelon
Get 384 milkmelon
Use 48 milkmelon, 240 sand (1 stack), and 96 mulch to get 96 more seeds
Left with 336 milkmelon
Use 336 milkmelon, 336 salt, 336 water to get 1009 milk
1009 milk = 5045 of organic
= 504.5 mulch (5 stacks of milk or 50 milk = 25 fertilizer)
= Net positive of 398.5 mulch

Other option is Plant 96 tomato
Gather 3 times or 9 tomatoes each, 864 total tomatoes
Use 192 tomatoes + 960 sand to get 96 tomato seeds
Left with 656 tomatoes = 1968 mulch

Milkmelon is MUCH better

* PRO: Saves 720 sand
* PRO: 3077 extra organic value (307.7 extra mulch, minus 96 = 211.7 extra mulch)
* PRO: Only harvest twice instead of 3 times
  * Get 4  stacks of mulch per planting instead of 2
* PRO: Easy to make cheese
* CON: Need to 'cook' the milk, 5s * 336 = 1680 seconds, almost 30 minutes
  * But don't need to pay too close attention...  Could
* CON: Requires salt (but only 336, just a trip to the ocean)
* CON: Requires water (need to have extra 400 glass bottles around)

Crafting is 6 * 50 seconds or 300 seconds (5 minutes)
and it turns 60 milkmelon into 180 milk, enough for 90 mulch

Even without crafting the milk, get about 1700 organic (170 mulch)
